👋 Hi, I’m @Remi Janet.
👀 I’m interested in the neurobiological mechanisms supporting inter-individual differences in everyday behaviors.
🌱 I’m currently learning the basics behind graph theory analysis in order to apply it to brain data. Using the metrics from the graph theory, I will be able to investigate the inter-individual differences in connectivity patterns of large brain networks.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dietary choices and social cooperative vs. competitive choices.
